                In the year 1980, the video game industry was still in its adolescence. Arcades were very popular; 
                a place for people to have competitions and escape into a different world of pixels. Alongside this, 
                video game consoles were starting to make their way as common household objects.
            </div>
            <div>
                Over the next three decades, this industry grew significantly, both in technological advancements and 
                cultural impact. The evolution of video game genres, as depicted by this interactive bar chart, 
                captures the trends in consumer's interests and how the digital entertainment realm easily changes.

                Our line graph offers a glimpse into the fluctuating sale trends
                for video games over the years. As you trace the highs and lows of the graph, 
                you can pinpoint some certain economic shifts, worldly events, and certain popular game 
                releases. For example, 2008 had the biggest year of sales that debuted some of the best
                selling games like Mario Kart Wii and Grand Theft Auto IV.

                This visualization depicts the evolving interests and engagement of the 
                industry's global audience. The line graph not only shares the history of 
                consumer's interest in gaming, but how also how the culture for it has changed.

                Similar to the line chart, this stacked area chart also displays the global sales of video games 
                over the years. However, this visualization also categorizes each area by genre. Categorizing by genre
                makes it more apparent to note the types of games that a consumer enjoys more. 
            </div>
            <div> 
                The top three genre's for video games are strategy, adventure, and fighting. 
                Specifically, popular games that are in this category include Pokemon Stadium (Strategy), Assassin's Creed 
                (Adventure), and Super Smash Bros (Fighting). Therefore, this graph allows you to individually look at the
                 each genre's market and audience likeness for a certain type of game.

                To go along, this pie chart shows how each genre does specifically throughout the years. 
                You can toggle between the years, anywhere between 1980-2016, to see how each gaming genre shifts 
                in popularity and production. It also highlights when new genres are created or get big enough to become notable.

                From the dominance of action and sports games, to the constant likeness for puzzle and platform games,

                Now we can turn our attention to console-specific trends. This graph allows us to closely
                examine the sales for games used specifically for the PlayStation 4. Here we can see how North
                America, Europe, and Japan contribute to these game sales 
                compared to the rest of the world.
            </div>
            <div>
                It is apparent that these three regions make up most of the sales for 
                PS4 games. This analysis shows just how big gaming culture varies by region as well. While our Region Sales Graph
                vividly displays the direction of sales from North America, it notably lacks data from other regions/continents like South
                America and Oceania. This can reflect the difference in market size and gaming popularity/culture in these regions.

                Now that we have shown which regions purchase the most games, we can explore which games
                those regions prefer to play. This heatmap provides a vivid illustration of regional gaming preferences. 
                It showcases the most popular genres, derived from their sales number, across different parts of the world.
            </div>
            <div>
                It appears regions across the world love their games in a similar way. The highest selling countries of North America and 
                Europe love to play Action and Shooter games, with Xbox One users also playing Sports games such as Forza Motorsport 5.
                Xbox One tended to better Playstation 4 in many categories, as the sales for genres across the board favors the Microsoft Console.

            Knowing the regions most preferred genres, we can expand on the heatmap visualization by looking at which games each
            region prefers to play over time. By integrating a pie chart for each game played, we can see: when the game came out,
            how popular the game was that year and the ratio between which regions play it.
            </div>
            <div>
            By having the pie graphs as data points it more clearly depicts which countries have contributed to the growth
            of the video game industry, by looking at the height a video game has landed on the chart, we can make an inference as to 
            what kind of games to create for the future.

                In many cases post- launch, users would like to know how other people rate a game before they make a purchase. By
                making a scatter plot, we can see how strong the relationship between these user scores and purchases are.
            </div>
            <div>
                From the graph we can see that there is a strong relationship between these user scores and the sales for a video game.
                When a game is rated higher, more people tend to buy it, and a poorly rated game will not recieve as many post-launch sales.
                This shows that a quality product will pay dividends over time.
